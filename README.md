# PhoneDetect Project

Simple webcam-based phone detector using YOLOv5 via torch.hub.


🔍 Working Principle

Captures live video frames from your webcam using OpenCV.

Each frame is processed by YOLOv5 to detect objects.

## 📘 Description
The Phone Detector is a computer vision project that uses a webcam and a YOLOv5 object detection model to automatically detect the presence of a mobile phone in real time.
It combines the power of OpenCV for video processing and YOLOv5 for deep learning–based detection, providing fast and accurate results on live camera feed.

This project can be used to monitor phone usage in classrooms, offices, and online exam setups — or integrated into IoT security systems for automation and safety.
